### Calculator Program

`calculate` method can take expressions having multiple spaces in it at any place of string, so handle it correctly, i.e., expressions like below are valid inputs to the method.

```js
1. '(   15 + 3) /   6   '
2. '10 +   2 *    (   6 - (4 + 1) / 2) + 7'
```

Handle expressions with invalid non-numerical characters, like `'5 + abc'`

Can you write a program in javascript to test if a given string is palindrome or not in most optimal way ?

Can you write automated rigorous jest tests to test the above palindrome function?
