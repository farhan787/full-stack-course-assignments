## JavaScript Assignments

You are provided empty JavaScript files (or having function signatures) in this directory. You have to follow the instructions given in each file and then run automated tests (also mentioned in each file) to check if you have successfully completed the assignment or you still have few more things to learn in it ðŸ˜œ

### Assignments
Feel free to start doing these in any order you like.
1. Anagram
2. Palindrome
3. Calculator
4. Todo List
5. Expenditure Analysis
6. Duplicate Transactions

#### Important Notes
1. If you are unable to understand the input/output of any assignment file or whatever the way it is being tested, you can take a look at its respective test file present in `tests/` directory.
2. Don't try to make any changes to the test files present in the `tests/` directory.
3. To make sure that you have not missed any assignment you can run a final test command in terminal `npm run test-all`.
4. Don't make any changes to the code already present in files including function/method/class signatures and module exports.

#### Development Setup
1. No setup needed. 
2. We used `18.x.y` Node.js version, if anything doesn't work then please consider upgrading your node installation.
