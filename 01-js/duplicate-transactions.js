/*
  Implement a function `findDuplicateTransactions` which takes a list of transactions and returns a list of duplicate transactoins.
  Transaction is an object like { itemName, category, price, timestamp } and two transactions are duplicate if they have every field same except timestamp,
  if the timestamps have a differece of <= 60 seconds then the transactions are duplicate.

  Once you've implemented the logic, test your code by running
  - `npm run test-duplicate-transactions`

function findDuplicateTransactions(transactions) {
  return [];
