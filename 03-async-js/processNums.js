/**
 Write a function called `processNums` that takes an array of numbers as input.
  The function should use promise chaining to perform the following operations in **order**:
    - Multiply each number in the array by 2.
    - Filter out any numbers that are less than 10.
    - Square each remaining number.
    - Calculate the sum of all the squared numbers.
    - The function should return a promise that resolves with the final sum.

    Once you've implemented the logic, test your code by running
    - `npm run test-processNums`
 */
function processNums(numbers) {}

module.exports = processNums;
